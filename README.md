This repository contain the code for the batchelor thesis "Towards Explainable Artificial Text Detection", written by R.E.M. van 't Hull.

The main dataset used within this thesis is the GPT-2 output set, which is accessible at https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset . Furthermore, for the evaluation of the generalization of the algorithms developed in this thesis, a Grover dataset (https://github.com/rowanz/grover) and a GPT-2 dataset created by Riemer Dijsktra (details are to be found in his thesis) were used.




The thesis can be found here: https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=723230 .
