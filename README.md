This repository contain the code for the batchelor thesis "Towards Explainable Artificial Text Detection", written by R.E.M. van 't Hull.

The main dataset used within this thesis is the GPT-2 output set, which is accessible at https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset . Furthermore, for the evaluation of the generalization of the algorithms developed in this thesis, a Grover dataset (https://github.com/rowanz/grover) and a GPT-2 dataset created by Riemer Dijsktra (details are to be found in his thesis, https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=724159) were used.

Zipf_plot.ipynb contains the code and some examples of experiments for estimating and visualizing Zipf's law on GPT-2-generated and human-written text.

Mann_Whitney.ipynb contains the code and some examples of experiments for performing the different Mann-Whitney tests on GPT-2-generated and human-written text and, with that, an algorithm capable of performing automatic text classification, as well as an alternative approach to classifying short corpora.
